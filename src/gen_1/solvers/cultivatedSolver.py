# CultivtedSolver
# > search-free "grown" solution; growth from curated parts/ cultivated environment

# The Cultivated Solver will solve the common-substring problem without touching any
# "higher-dimensional negative-space coordinates", and without knowing anything about
# the higher-dimensional structutes (lower or higher dimensions) other than
# "immediate adjacency"

# solutions are grown, piece-by-piece, based upon a pre-curated reduction (and indexing) of
# possiblity-space to "only those parts (of the set of all) which (legally/ validly) go together"

# note: the commnon-x cultivated solver is a toy model of causality -- hear me out!
#   
#   what drives causality, is (sufficient) intersection within finite spaces/ reference-frames
#       
#   if we think of chemistry/ biology in four-dimensions of space-time
#   then only chemicals which become sufficiently adjacent have the potential to react, 
#   only a subset of which react, and a subset again form persisted stable forms
# 
#   the same applies to biological organisms: re reward/ avoidance, survival, and reproduction
# 
#   whatever volume of phenomena exist within physical spaces, not all is relevant all the time
#   not all is "at play"
# 
#   do we learn more by becoming overwhelemed by "the space of all possible", or do we intelligently 
#   culture or attention-spaces, to only those phenomena relelevant to an immediate need
# 
#   how else might we describe the cultivated solver?
